Okay, let's get started. The user wants me to tackle the refactoring tasks outlined in `TODO.md`. This is a significant undertaking, so I'll approach it methodically, starting with a thorough analysis of the codebase to inform a detailed refactoring plan.

First, I'll explore the project structure to locate the `llms.txt` file mentioned in the TODO list, which is said to contain a codebase snapshot. This will be my starting point for the analysis.

I've completed my analysis of the `llms.txt` file and have a solid grasp of the codebase. It's clear that while a good modularization effort has begun, further refactoring is needed to simplify the key components as outlined in `TODO.md`, especially concerning the `products` and `cli` modules.

My next step is to formulate a detailed refactoring plan in `PLAN.md`. This plan will serve as our roadmap, addressing each point from the TODO list, including the restructuring of the `products` directory, simplification of `cli.py`, and improvements to documentation and Windows support.

I will now write this comprehensive plan to `PLAN.md`.

- # Plan
+ # Refactoring Plan for Topyaz
+ 
+ This document outlines a detailed plan for refactoring the `topyaz` codebase to improve modularity, reduce complexity, and enhance maintainability. The plan is based on the analysis of the codebase and the requirements specified in `TODO.md`.
+ 
+ ## 1. Goal
+ 
+ The primary goal of this refactoring is to create a cleaner, more organized, and easier-to-maintain codebase. This will be achieved by:
+ 
+ *   Restructuring the `products` module.
+ *   Simplifying the `cli.py` module.
+ *   Improving code documentation.
+ *   Unifying shared code.
+ *   Reducing cognitive load by creating smaller, more focused modules.
+ 
+ ## 2. Refactoring Steps
+ 
+ ### Step 1: Restructure the `products` directory
+ 
+ The current `products` directory contains all product-specific logic in flat files, which are getting large and complex. We will restructure this as follows:
+ 
+ 1.  Create new directories for each product:
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/gigapixel/`
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/`
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/video_ai/`
+ 2.  Move the existing product files into their respective new directories and rename them to `api.py`:
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/gigapixel.py` -> `src/topyaz/products/gigapixel/api.py`
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai.py` -> `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/api.py`
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/video_ai.py` -> `src/topyaz/products/video_ai/api.py`
+ 3.  The `api.py` file will contain the main product class (e.g., `GigapixelAI`).
+ 4.  Create `__init__.py` in each new product directory to expose the main class.
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/gigapixel/__init__.py` will contain `from .api import GigapixelAI`
+ 5.  Break down the logic within each `api.py` into smaller, more focused modules within the product's directory. For example, for `photo_ai`:
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/api.py`: The main `PhotoAI` class.
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/batch.py`: Logic for handling batch processing, including the 450-image limit.
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/params.py`: Validation and building of Photo AI parameters.
+     *   `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/preferences.py`: Logic for handling Photo AI preferences (currently in `system/photo_ai_prefs.py`).
+ 6.  Update `src/topyaz/products/__init__.py` to import from the new sub-packages.
+ 7.  `products/base.py` will remain as it is, providing the base class for all products.
+ 
+ ### Step 2: Simplify `cli.py`
+ 
+ The `cli.py` module currently contains too much logic for handling parameters. It should be a thin wrapper that calls the product-specific code.
+ 
+ 1.  The CLI methods (`giga`, `video`, `photo`) in `TopyazCLI` will be simplified.
+ 2.  Instead of accepting dozens of parameters, they will accept `input_path`, `output_path` and a generic `**kwargs`.
+ 3.  The `kwargs` will be passed directly to the `process` method of the corresponding product class.
+ 4.  All parameter validation and command building logic will be handled within the respective product modules, not in `cli.py`.
+ 
+ **Example of simplified `giga` method in `cli.py`:**
+ 
+ ```python
+ def giga(self, input_path: str, output: str | None = None, **kwargs) -> bool:
+     try:
+         logger.info(f"Processing {input_path} with Gigapixel AI")
+         result = self._gigapixel.process(
+             input_path=input_path,
+             output_path=output,
+             **kwargs,
+         )
+         # ... (error handling)
+     except Exception as e:
+         logger.error(f"Gigapixel AI processing failed: {e}")
+         return False
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Step 3: Unify and Centralize Shared Code
+ 
+ We will identify and centralize shared code to avoid duplication.
+ 
+ 1.  **Path Handling:** The `PathValidator` in `system/paths.py` is well-designed. We will ensure all path operations use this class.
+ 2.  **Parameter Validation:** Each product module will have its own parameter validation logic, but we will look for opportunities to create shared validation utilities in `topyaz/utils/validation.py`. For example, a function to validate a value is within a given range.
+ 3.  **Command Building:** The `build_command` method in each product class will be responsible for creating the command list. We will ensure that common patterns are abstracted if possible.
+ 
+ ### Step 4: Improve Documentation
+ 
+ Documentation is crucial for maintainability. We will improve it at all levels.
+ 
+ 1.  **Docstrings:** Every module, class, function, and method will have a clear and concise docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values, following PEP 257.
+ 2.  **`Used in:` sections:** We will continue the practice of adding `- Used in:` sections to docstrings to document dependencies between modules.
+ 3.  **`README.md`:** The `README.md` will be updated to reflect the new project structure and provide clear usage examples for the CLI.
+ 4.  **`PLAN.md`:** This document will serve as the living specification for the refactoring process.
+ 
+ ### Step 5: Improve Windows Handling
+ 
+ The current codebase has some stubs for Windows paths. We will improve this by:
+ 
+ 1.  Testing path resolution on Windows.
+ 2.  Ensuring that all hardcoded paths are replaced with platform-aware logic (e.g., using `pathlib` and `platform.system()`).
+ 3.  Adding Windows-specific search paths for all Topaz products in their respective `get_search_paths` methods.
+ 
+ ### Step 6: Reduce Cognitive Load
+ 
+ The main goal is to make the code easier to understand. This will be achieved by:
+ 
+ *   Creating smaller files with a single responsibility.
+ *   Using clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
+ *   Favoring flat structures over nested ones.
+ *   Adding comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.
+ 
+ ## 3. Post-Refactoring Steps
+ 
+ After the refactoring is complete, we will perform the following steps:
+ 
+ 1.  **Testing:** Run the existing test suite (`tests/test_refactoring.py`) and add new tests to cover the refactored code.
+ 2.  **Linting and Formatting:** Run `ruff` and other tools to ensure code quality and consistency.
+ 3.  **Review:** Perform a final review of the refactored codebase to ensure all goals have been met.
```

Okay, plan's done. I'm starting with restructuring the `products` directory now. I'll create `src/topyaz/products/gigapixel/`, `src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/`, and `src/topyaz/products/video_ai/` using `mkdir -p`.

---

```bash
mkdir -p src/topyaz/products/gigapixel src/topyaz/products/photo_ai src/topyaz/products/video_ai
```

```
topyazadam@Hamlet topyaz % 

```

---



---

Directories are ready; time to move the files. I'll use `mv` in the terminal for each one.

---

```bash
mv src/topyaz/products/gigapixel.py src/topyaz/products/gigapixel/api.py
```

```
topyazadam@Hamlet topyaz % 

```

---



---

Moved `gigapixel.py`. Now, `photo_ai.py`.

---

```bash
mv src/topyaz/products/photo_ai.py src/topyaz/products/photo_ai/api.py
```

```
topyazadam@Hamlet topyaz % 

```

---



---

Moved `photo_ai.py`. Moving `video_ai.py` next.

---

```bash
mv src/topyaz/products/video_ai.py src/topyaz/products/video_ai/api.py
```

```
topyazadam@Hamlet topyaz % 

```

---



---

Files moved. Now, create `__init__.py` in each new product directory to expose main classes: `GigapixelAI`, `PhotoAI`, and `VideoAI`. I'll use `edit_file` to do this.

---

```diff
- 
+ from .api import GigapixelAI
+ 
+ __all__ = ["GigapixelAI"] 
```

---



---

Okay, `__init__.py` for `gigapixel` is done. Next, `photo_ai`.

---

```diff
- 
+ from .api import PhotoAI
+ 
+ __all__ = ["PhotoAI"] 
```

---



---

Okay, `__init__.py` is done for `photo_ai`. Next, `video_ai`.

---

```diff
- 
+ from .api import VideoAI
+ 
+ __all__ = ["VideoAI"] 
```

---



---

Okay, I'm updating `src/topyaz/products/__init__.py` to import from the new sub-packages I just created. First, I'll read the file, then make the necessary changes.

---

Read file: src/topyaz/products/__init__.py

---



---

I've read `src/topyaz/products/__init__.py` and see the imports are broken due to file moves. I'll now edit that file to correctly import `GigapixelAI` from the new `topyaz.products.gigapixel` sub-package and likewise for the other products, reflecting the new project structure.

---



---



---

The model's inaction was my fault; I missed the necessary import path updates. I need to correct the `from` statements in `products/__init__.py` to reflect the new subpackage structure and also update the `create_product` function's imports in `products/base.py`. I'll start by fixing the `__init__.py` file.

---



---



---

The model isn't accepting my changes. I'll re-evaluate. I'll review `src/topyaz/products/base.py` to check the `create_product` function before trying the `__init__.py` again.

---

Read file: src/topyaz/products/base.py

---



---

I see the problem: `create_product` in `src/topyaz/products/base.py` uses outdated, hardcoded imports. I need to update them to reflect the new modular structure, specifically changing `from topyaz.products.gigapixel import GigapixelAI` to `from topyaz.products.gigapixel.api import GigapixelAI`, and similarly for video and photo products. The `edit_file` tool seems to be failing, so I'll be more explicit with my changes, starting with `create_product` in `base.py`, then `cli.py`.

---

```diff
      # Import here to avoid circular imports
      if product_type == Product.GIGAPIXEL:
-         from topyaz.products.gigapixel import GigapixelAI
+         from topyaz.products.gigapixel.api import GigapixelAI
  
          return GigapixelAI(executor, options)
      if product_type == Product.VIDEO_AI:
-         from topyaz.products.video_ai import VideoAI
+         from topyaz.products.video_ai.api import VideoAI
  
          return VideoAI(executor, options)
      if product_type == Product.PHOTO_AI:
-         from topyaz.products.photo_ai import PhotoAI
+         from topyaz.products.photo_ai.api import PhotoAI
  
          return PhotoAI(executor, options)
```

---



---

Okay, I'll ignore the docstring linter errors for now and focus on refactoring. The immediate issue is `products/__init__.py`; it still uses old imports. Although I'm confused why the previous attempts to fix it failed, I'll try again, this time being more explicit with my changes to ensure `GigapixelAI`, `PhotoAI`, and `VideoAI` are imported correctly from their respective new package locations.

---



---



---

The model's being stubborn. I'll switch gears and refactor `cli.py` first, hoping a structural change will force the model to recognize the new layout. I'll read the file, then simplify it as planned.

---

Read file: src/topyaz/cli.py

---



---

Okay, I've reviewed `cli.py` and it's too complex. I'll simplify the `giga`, `video`, and `photo` methods in `TopyazCLI` by having them accept `**kwargs` and pass those directly to the product's `process` method, streamlining the code as planned. I'm applying these changes now.

No no, no kwargs. We need to explicitly list all shared arguments in __init__ and all tool-specific arguments in giga, video and photo — along extensive docstrings — because this is where the CLI is built via Fire!

Oh for fuck's sake. Restore them from git or whatever.

I understand. My apologies for that misstep. I will restore `src/topyaz/cli.py` from git immediately.

---

```bash
git restore src/topyaz/cli.py
```

```
topyazadam@Hamlet topyaz % 

```

---

`src/topyaz/cli.py` has been restored to its previous state. I apologize for the error. I will now proceed with the refactoring, keeping the CLI arguments explicit as you requested.

The next step is to fix the imports in `src/topyaz/products/__init__.py`. I will read the file again and apply the correct imports.

---

Read file: src/topyaz/products/__init__.py

---

I see the problem in `src/topyaz/products/__init__.py`. The `from` paths for `GigapixelAI`, `PhotoAI`, and `VideoAI` are incorrect due to the restructuring. I will now correct them to point to the new sub-packages.

---



---

The model is still not applying the changes to `src/topyaz/products/__init__.py`. I will try a different approach. I will list the contents of the `src/topyaz` directory to confirm the new structure and then try to edit the `__init__.py` file again.
