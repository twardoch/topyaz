### Input Validation

- [ ] Comprehensive path validation:
  - [ ] Path expansion and normalization
  - [ ] Permission checks (read/write access)
  - [ ] Space character handling in paths
  - [ ] Output directory creation
  - [ ] Recursive directory validation
- [ ] Parameter validation for all products
- [ ] File format compatibility checking

## Phase 2: Remote Execution (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### SSH Implementation
