## Core Processing Components

### Media Enhancement Algorithms 
- Photo AI processing with autopilot presets and enhancement options including noise reduction, sharpening, and upscaling
- Gigapixel AI upscaling with model selection (standard, art & CG, recovery, generative) 
- Video AI processing with frame interpolation, stabilization and denoising capabilities

Importance Score: 95

### Batch Processing Engine
- Intelligent batch operations management with real-time progress monitoring
- Error recovery mechanisms for handling processing failures
- Remote execution support for distributed workload management
