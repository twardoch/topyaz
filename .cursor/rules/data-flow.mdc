# Data-Flow

## Core Data Movement Patterns

1. Remote Processing Pipeline
- Location: `topyaz/execution/remote.py`
- Handles bidirectional file transfer between local and remote systems
- Manages SSH-based data streaming for media file processing
- Implements resumable file transfers for large media collections
- Importance Score: 95

2. Batch Operation Data Flow
- Location: `topyaz/cli/batch.py`
- Orchestrates parallel processing streams for multiple files
- Tracks processing status and progress across file groups
- Maintains processing state for recovery scenarios
- Importance Score: 90

3. Error Recovery Data Paths
- Location: `topyaz/error_handling/__init__.py`
- Implements checkpointing for batch processing operations
- Records processing state for interrupted operations
- Manages data integrity during failure scenarios
- Importance Score: 85

## Data Monitoring

1. Progress Tracking
- Location: `topyaz/cli/batch.py`
- Real-time monitoring of file processing status
- Collection of processing metrics per file
- Aggregation of batch operation statistics
- Importance Score: 75

2. Error State Management
- Location: `topyaz/error_handling/__init__.py`
- Tracking of failed operations and their causes
- Recording of partial processing results
- Management of retry queues and recovery states
- Importance Score: 80

## File Handling

1. Media File Processing
- Specialized handling for video and image file formats
- Tracking of file dependencies during batch operations
- Management of temporary processing artifacts
- Importance Score: 85

2. Configuration Data Flow
- YAML-based configuration management
- Remote host configuration synchronization
- Product-specific setting propagation
- Importance Score: 70
