### Core Data Flow Components

1. Remote Execution Pipeline
- Files are transferred to remote hosts via SSH for processing
- Status updates and results streamed back to local client
- File path: `src/topyaz/execution/remote.py`

2. Progress Monitoring Flow 
- Real-time status updates during batch processing
- ETA calculations based on completed items
- Error recovery with detailed processing outcomes
- File path: `src/topyaz/execution/base.py`

3. Product-Specific Processing Flows
- Photo AI: Autopilot preferences management and format conversion
- Video AI: Frame-by-frame processing with stabilization data
- Gigapixel AI: Model-specific parameter handling
- File paths:
  - `src/topyaz/products/_photo_ai.py`
  - `src/topyaz/products/_video_ai.py` 
  - `src/topyaz/products/_gigapixel.py`

4. Error Recovery Pipeline
- Failed items tracked in ProcessingResult objects
- Automatic retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Detailed error reporting for manual intervention
- File path: `src/topyaz/products/base.py`

5. Batch Processing Flow
- Intelligent grouping of files for optimal processing
- Progress monitoring with completion estimates
- Temporary directory management for processing
- File path: `src/topyaz/execution/base.py`

### Critical Data Exchange Points

1. Remote Host Communication
- Secure file transfer protocols
- Command execution via SSH
- Status/progress streaming
- File path: `src/topyaz/execution/remote.py`

2. Processing Results Collection
- Standardized result objects across products
- Error categorization and recovery options
- Success/failure tracking
- File path: `src/topyaz/products/base.py`
