# remote-execution

The remote execution system implements the following key business components:

### SSH-Based Remote Processing
- Located in `topyaz/execution/remote.py`
- Enables distributed processing of media files across remote machines
- Handles connection management and task distribution
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes

### Security Implementation
- Located in `topyaz/security/__init__.py`  
- SSH key-based authentication for secure remote access
- Secure file transfer protocols for media transmission
- Command injection prevention mechanisms
- Validates remote host integrity and permissions

### Hardware Optimization
- Located in `topyaz/optimization/hardware.py`
- Automatically detects and optimizes for remote system capabilities:
  - CPU architecture (Apple Silicon vs Intel)
  - GPU availability and specifications
  - Storage speed and capacity
- Dynamically adjusts processing parameters based on hardware specs

### Remote Configuration
- Managed via YAML configuration
- Stores remote host details
- Defines processing preferences per remote machine
- Handles connection retry policies and timeout settings

Importance Scores:
- SSH Implementation: 85 (Key integration point for distributed processing)
- Security Measures: 90 (Critical for protecting remote operations)
- Hardware Optimization: 75 (Important for processing efficiency)
- Remote Configuration: 65 (Supporting functionality)
