# remote-execution

### SSH Implementation
- Implements secure remote task execution through SSH protocol
- Enables distributed processing on powerful remote machines
- File transfer protocols for secure media file handling between local and remote systems
- SSH key-based authentication system for secure connections

### Security Measures
- SSH key validation and verification before establishing connections
- Secure file transfer protocols for media files
- Command injection prevention through parameterized execution
- Authentication state validation throughout remote sessions

### Hardware Optimization
- Automatic detection of remote system hardware capabilities
- Optimization for different architectures (Apple Silicon/Intel)
- Resource allocation based on available remote system capabilities
- Dynamic workload distribution across remote processing nodes

### Relevant File Paths
```
src/topyaz/execution/remote.py      # RemoteExecutor class implementation
src/topyaz/execution/base.py        # Base command execution framework
src/topyaz/system/paths.py          # System path validation and hardware detection
```

### Component Integration
- RemoteExecutor class manages SSH connections and command distribution
- PathValidator ensures valid remote system paths and permissions
- CommandExecutor handles remote command execution and monitoring
- Hardware detection components optimize processing parameters

Importance Scores:
- Remote Execution Core: 95 (Critical business functionality)
- Security Implementation: 90 (Essential for secure operations)
- Hardware Optimization: 85 (Key performance feature)
- Path Validation: 75 (Important for reliable operation)
