## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Product Integration

The system provides unified CLI access to Topaz Labs' AI products through three main processing components:

1. Photo AI Processing
- Manages photo enhancement workflows with autopilot capabilities
- Controls preference-based processing parameters
- Handles batch operations with intelligent error recovery
- File: `src/topyaz/products/_photo_ai.py`

2. Gigapixel AI Processing  
- Implements specialized upscaling models for different image types
- Enforces Pro license requirements
- Controls model-specific parameter optimization
- File: `src/topyaz/products/_gigapixel.py`

3. Video AI Processing
- Manages video enhancement and upscaling workflows
- Controls frame interpolation and stabilization
- Handles video-specific processing parameters
- File: `src/topyaz/products/_video_ai.py`

## Remote Processing Architecture

The system enables distributed media processing through:

1. SSH-Based Execution
- Manages secure remote file transfers
- Controls remote hardware optimization
- Handles distributed processing coordination
- File: `src/topyaz/execution/remote.py`

2. Batch Processing Engine
- Implements intelligent batch operation management
- Controls progress monitoring and error recovery
- Manages processing preferences and parameters
- File: `src/topyaz/execution/base.py`

## Security and Licensing

1. Access Control
- Validates Pro license requirements
- Manages SSH key authentication
- Controls system requirement validation

2. Processing Safety
- Implements secure parameter validation
- Controls command injection prevention
- Manages processing environment isolation

## Configuration Management

1. Product Settings
- Manages autopilot preferences
- Controls processing parameters
- Handles format-specific configurations
- File: `src/topyaz/system/preferences.py`

2. System Validation
- Controls hardware detection
- Manages license verification
- Handles environment validation
- File: `src/topyaz/system/paths.py`
